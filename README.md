# üìö Programming Challenges Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to a set of programming challenges that cover various topics in computer science. These challenges are designed to test problem-solving skills and improve proficiency in programming.

The repository includes solutions to the following challenges:

1. **Prime Factorization**: 
   - Decompose a number into its prime factors and format the output.
   - Example: `28 = 2^2 * 7`

2. **Base Conversion**: 
   - Convert a decimal number to a specified base.
   - Example: `247` in base `7` ‚û°Ô∏è `502`

3. **Trigonometric Series**: 
   - Calculate `Sin(x)` and `Cos(x)` using a series expansion.
   - Example: `Sin(1.57) = 0.99984`, `Cos(1.57) = -0.0000946`

4. **Pascal's Triangle**: 
   - Generate the first `n` lines of Pascal‚Äôs Triangle.
   - Example for `n = 7`: 
     ```
     1
     1 1
     1 2 1
     ...
     ```

5. **Guessing Game**: 
   - A multiplayer game where each player guesses a random number.
   - Example: Players guess numbers until they find the correct one, with the winner having the fewest guesses.

6. **Statistical Analysis**: 
   - Compute the average, mode, median, and range from a list of numbers.
   - Example: 
     ```
     Average = 72.968
     Modes = 61.21, 76.25
     Median = 73.415
     Range = 39.93
     ```

7. **Set Operations**: 
   - Perform various operations on sets such as union, intersection, and complements.
   - Example: `A Union B = {1, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 20}`

8. **String Occurrences**: 
   - Find all positions of a string or its reverse in another string.
   - Example: `{3, -12}` for the string `abc` in `nbpabcggaccbaxui`

9. **Rectangle Counting**: 
    - Count the total number of rectangles and non-square rectangles in a grid.
    - Example: `Total = 18`, `Not squares = 10`
